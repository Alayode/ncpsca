  			<h1>Pet Adoption</h1>
            <p><span class="title">Can you provide a safe and permanent home for a furry-friend?</span>
           Millions of dogs and cats are euthanized each year in the US because they are homeless. Adopting instead of buying a pet will save a life. These abandoned and neglected animals need your help right now.</p>
            <p>The NCSPCA adoption database is under construction, and will be dedicated to creating a community where adoptable animals will be placed in loving homes.</p>
            <p>Local shelters have both purebreds and one-of-a-kinds, and their staff will find the perfect match for you and your family. All animals adopted from NCSPCA are evaluated and cleared before becoming available for adoption.  WE also require a completed application and background check before animals are placed in a new home.</p>

They have to be adopted that way <br />

While he was with his person, he went hiking, swimming - got lots of exercise and was a loving sweet boy. &nbsp;He is only 2 years old now and his person is in debt, and can no longer afford to keep him in boarding.&nbsp;<br />

She is very playful, lovable and gentle. My son is not willing to take care of her, and due to my schedule; I don't have the time, therefore she is not really house trained, she is fine with children, since my grandson visits and I haven't had a problem, she is very jumpy and gets excited when she sees people, or I have company. Some people don't like dogs that want to climb up your leg for attention. I don't know if she is good with cats, with other dogs she likes to play, and on the weekends when I don't work we place fetch, and she loves it. She has had all her shots and is very healthy. Scarlet gets fed twice a day half dry and half can of wet food. She loves treats. I would like someone who will treat her as a family member and be kind to her. If you think you are the right person, please contact me to arrange a meeting. This dog is not for sale just up for adoption; there is no fee. Therefore the person whom I decide to give Scarlet to, has to be kind and willing to be patient with her. I would also need to visit said person, to make sure the living conditions are good for Scarlet. Dog is up for adoption, but I love Scarlet and want the best for her. The right person will understand my feelings</span></span></span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="font-family: Arial;">. - </span></span><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Blanca</span></span></span></span></span><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">

</strong></span><br />
Chance was found in south Hempstead, horribly beat up in the face and neck; it was clear that he <img name="ACCOUNT.IMAGE.21" align="left" alt="" border="0" vspace="5" _mce_src="https://origin.ih.constantcontact.com/fs082/1106304554429/img/21.jpg" jquery17109501519575876636="131" style="width: 186px; height: 174px;" src="https://origin.ih.constantcontact.com/fs082/1106304554429/img/21.jpg" />had been used as a &rsquo;bait&rdquo; dog by whomever had him. We named him Chance as we hoped he would have another &ldquo;chance&rdquo; at a decent life. He was held at the Freeport Humane Society but due to some issues created by his horrific past, adoption was not happening any time soon. Finally one of the Freeport volunteers who always had a soft spot for him decided to bring him home. With the love and patience of his new owners and the expert assistance of Steve DiTiullio of <a href="http://forpawzdogtraining.com">forpawzdogtraining.com</a>, Chance has an excellent opportunity to have a happy ending.</span></span></div>

This newsletter is about a special individual who went the extra &quot;yard&quot; to work with Cleo and correct some of the issues that would have hindered her having a successful placement in a new home.

I met Cleo only once, but having dealt extensively with 'rotties&quot;,I saw some something in her and Steve has brought it out; Steve did the screening of potential adopters and made the final choice; he knows Cleo better than anyone and we're confident in his choice. God Bless you Steve.
